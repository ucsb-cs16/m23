Hi, everyone! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the CS department. My research area is automated verification techniques with Prof. Tevfik Bultan. In my research area, we deal with automating the process of program verification which prevents the code from being exploited by an adversary.   

I’m a TA for CS 16 to help you with any questions you may have regarding your CS 16 coursework or computer science in general. If you need any help with the coursework or career in computer science, feel free to contact me via piazza or drop by in my student hours on Mondays(4-5pm). I’m looking forward to assist you in coding.
